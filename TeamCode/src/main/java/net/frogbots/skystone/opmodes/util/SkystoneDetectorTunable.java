     * In other words, the processFrame() method will never be called multiple times simultaneously.

     * viewport does NOT impact the amount of frames per second that your pipeline can process.
     *
     * IMPORTANT NOTE: this pipeline is NOT invoked on your OpMode thread. It is invoked on the
     * frame worker thread. This should not be a problem in the vast majority of cases. However,
     * if you're doing something weird where you do need it synchronized with your OpMode thread,
     * then you will need to account for that accordingly.
